The Storage server system board crashed, and the server won't go up. Replacement part are purchased and should be available soon.  

**UPDATE 2020.07.01:** Replacement came, supplier sent a defective part and doesn't have any other one in stock.  
A quote for a new server has been asked but could take some time to arrive.
